/*
The HTML DOM (Document Object Model) :--------------
    >When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page.
    >It defines:--
        -The HTML elements as objects.
        -The properties of all HTML elements.
        -The methods to access all HTML elements.
        -The events for all HTML elements.
    >In other words: The HTML DOM is a standard for how to get, change, add, or delete HTML elements.
    >The HTML DOM model is constructed as a tree of Objects.
    >There are 3 main type of nodes in the DOM tree.
        -TEXT node
        -ELEMENT node
        -COMMENT node
     ->Tags are element nodes (or just elements) and form the tree structure.
     -><html> is at the root, then <head> and <body> are its children, etc. 
     ->The text inside elements forms text nodes, labelled as #text . A text node contains only a string.
     ->Text node is a always a leaf node of the tree.
